Before moving on to the LINUX lets have a small talk ☕️
An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.
Lets take a look at 1969 its time when ken Thompson and Dennnis Ritchie created unix operating system its was all good but it had one problem the 
source code was owned by AT and T company when some other created their own software distribution based on unix AT and T sues them this led to the 
limitatiins to the development. 

To encounter this problen in year 1983 Richard Stallman created GNU( it literally means not unix 😂) project intended to make free and open source 
replacement to unix in 1992 it included linux under GNU project under general public license, linux was created in 1991 by linus Torwalds a 
kernel which act as a mediater between hardware and applications, user interact with kernel with the help of shell through command line. in GNU's 
upcomming years it created may tols and applications like tar, bash just the name of few which can be used by linux kernel that let to revolution 
in software world.

As it gave freedom to developers tonnes of developers made their contributions and created thousand of linux distro A distro is a complete operating
system based on linux kernel which comes with linux kernel packages package-manager Graphic-user-interface. The family tree of linux is huge 
but have one thing in common tyhe seed of linux with  tools, utilities and freedom provided by GNU 

We will be understanding the basics of linux topics like core-concepts package-manager file-system networking storage secuerity-filepermissions
and many more. 😀
